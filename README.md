# Overview 
 
  The FellowBloggerV2 is a blogging app that enables users to post and view other blogs created by fellow bloggers. The backend is created using Firebase. The database has existing data. You will be using the included GoogleService-Info.plist file to read and write to Firebase. Everyone will be using the same database to give the project a more real life feel with having existing users. Firebase handles authentication, database and storage requirements for the app.
